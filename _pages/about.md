I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in computer science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), advised by [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VWX-GMAAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Visual Computing Group (VCG)](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/). I obtained my master's degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yang Li](http://yangli-feasibility.com/home/). Prior to that, I spent wonderful 4 years at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) and obtained my bachelor's degree in 2019.

I'm very fortunate to have interned at [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) (with [Prof. Dmitri "Mitya" B. Chklovskii](https://neural-circuits-and-algorithms.github.io/) and [Dr. Jingpeng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZB6o8OMAAAAJ&hl=en)), [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (with [Prof. Nir Shavit](https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/)), [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) (with [Prof. Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/)), and [Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.](https://www.huawei.com/en/) (with Changzheng Zhang and [Prof. Nanshan Zhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Nanshan)'s team).

I aim at developing bleeding-edge AI techniques to address important real-world challenges. Specifically, my research interests are but not limited to:
* **AI for Healthcare/Medicine/Biology**,
* **Biomedical Image Analysis**,
* **Computational Neuroscience/Connectomics**.

Collaborations and casual chats are welcomed!
