I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) advised by [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VWX-GMAAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Visual Computing Group (VCG)](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/), and affiliated with [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/). I also work closely with [Prof. Jeff W. Lichtman](https://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20033158.html) and [Prof. Aravinthan D.T. Samuel](https://scholar.harvard.edu/aravisamuel) at Harvard's [Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.fas.harvard.edu/), and [Prof. Bill Lotter](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/people/william-lotter) at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).

I'm very fortunate to have interned (now a guest researcher) at [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/) (with [Prof. Dmitri "Mitya" B. Chklovskii](https://neural-circuits-and-algorithms.github.io/) and [Prof. Jingpeng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZB6o8OMAAAAJ&hl=en)), [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) (with [Prof. Nir Shavit](https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/)), Harvard Medical School (with [Prof. Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/)), and [Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.](https://www.huawei.com/en/) (with Changzheng Zhang and [Prof. Nanshan Zhong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Nanshan)'s team).

Prior to Harvard, I obtained my master's degree at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) advised by [Prof. Yang Li](http://yangli-feasibility.com/home/), and my bachelor's degree at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).

I aim at bridging the gap the betweem natural and artificial intelligence as well as developing bleeding-edge AI techniques to address important real-world challenges in **Healthcare**, **Medicine**, and **Neuroscience**. Specifically, my research interests are but not limited to:
* **Biomedical Image Analysis**,
* **Data-Efficient Learning**,
* **Computational Pathology**,
* **Computational Neuroscience/Connectomics**.

Collaborations and casual chats are welcomed!
