I'm a 1st-year Ph.D. student in computer science at Harvard University, advised by [Prof. Hanspeter Pfister](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VWX-GMAAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Visual Computing Group (VCG)](https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/). I obtained my master's degree at Tsinghua University in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yang Li](http://yangli-feasibility.com/home/). Prior to that, I spent wonderful 4 years at Sichuan University in Chengdu and obtained my bachelor's degree in 2019. I've also been very fortunate to work with [Prof. Nir Shavit](https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), [Prof. Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/) at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), and [Prof. Ercan Engin Kuruoglu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=To7e1toAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [CNR-ISTI](https://www.isti.cnr.it/en/). My research interests are but not limited to:
* **Biomedical Image Analysis**,
